## Mouser: Reference Guide to Switched DC/DC Conversion
_DC/DC converters convert one DC voltage level to another. Switched-mode DC/DC converters use a FET switch and a
storage element to first store energy, then release it to achieve the desired output voltage. The common arrangements
of switches and storage elements, or topologies, are shown below._
